The answer is: <tool:calculator>33 * 54</tool>

Option 1: Huggingface native / pytorch-toolformer
Option 2: Inference -> API
Option 3: Inference -> API -> Inference

Goal 1: Be ready for presentation tmr
- Purely arithmetic and QWEN
- Toolformer FT
- Graph of comparison

Goal 2: Stretch goal
- Pure fine tuned

Goal 3: Expand to more difficult datasets / cornell applications
